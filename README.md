# students-database
<p>This is my first year university project made with c++</p>
<h3>Development of a program for information search of students according to specified criteria</h3>

<p>Task: sort the entire group by increasing the year of admission to the university, indicating the interval of the year of birth</p>

<h3>Manual:</h3>
<div>
  <p>When the program starts, a console with a menu is displayed on the screen, where the user can select one of several items, such as: view the list of students (delete or change data), add student data to the database, save the student database to a file, perform option 79 (sort the entire group by increasing the year of admission to the university, indicating the interval of the year of birth). Depending on the option selected by the user, a certain part of the program is executed.</p>
<p>When you click "View the list of students (delete or change data)", the program displays a list of students with an indication of the study group and offers the "Delete student data" function, which can delete all information about the student from the database. Clicking on the student's full name opens the options: add/change the surname, add/change the name, add/change the patronymic, add/change the institute, add/change the department, add/change the group, add/change the number of the record book, add/change the gender, add/ change the year of admission to the university, add/change the date of birth, add/change grades. When you click "add/change grades", a list of sessions is displayed on the screen, when you click on any session, a list of subjects and grades for them is displayed on the screen. </p>
<p>When you click "Add student data to the database", the program prompts you to enter data about a new student from the keyboard.</p>
<p>When you click "Save Student database to file", the program saves the new information to a file.</p>
<p>When you click "Execute option 79", the program performs an individual task, sorts the entire group by increasing the year of admission to the university, indicating the interval of the year of birth. </p>
